** Project Overview**

This project is a full-stack application developed for the Bajaj Finserv Health Dev Challenge.
The solution is built using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase Functions (Dart) for the backend, ensuring a scalable, serverless, and efficient architecture.
The application processes user input in JSON format, categorizes the data into numbers and alphabets, identifies the highest alphabet, and
provides a real-time response using a REST API. The frontend allows users to interact with the API, apply filters, and view results dynamically.

**✅ Backend (Firebase Functions - Dart)**

REST API with two endpoints:
GET /bfhl → Returns { "operation_code": 1 }
POST /bfhl → Processes JSON data and returns categorized response.
Data Processing:
Separates numbers and alphabets.
Identifies the highest alphabet.
Returns structured JSON response.
Cloud-based & Serverless: Hosted on Firebase for high availability.

**✅ Frontend (Flutter App)**

JSON Input Field to enter test data.
API Call Integration to communicate with Firebase Functions.
Dynamic Multi-Select Filters for response customization.
Real-Time Data Processing & Display
Modern UI with Flutter Widgets (FilterChips, TextField, Buttons, etc.)
